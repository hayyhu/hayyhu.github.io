*Blind*


I encouraged slavery

against firefly's bravery

her light's a cheap delivery

Dark murders the scenery



I bribed the sun

to bring the dawn

she's crowned, no longer a pawn

yet torn apart, no longer one



I fooled the moon

not to wake up soon

behind my Eyes, her doom

a dream, at the brightest noon



above the shoulders of flowers

the questions planted answers

just what dissuaded the brightness

from filling my eyes with tears?
