<p class="verse">
I encouraged slavery<br  />
against firefly's bravery<br  />
her light's a cheap delivery<br  />
Dark murders the scenery<br  />
<br  />
I bribed the sun<br  />
to bring the dawn<br  />
she's crowned, no longer a pawn<br  />
yet torn apart, no longer one<br  />
<br  />
I fooled the moon<br  />
not to wake up soon<br  />
behind my Eyes, her doom<br  />
a dream, at the brightest noon<br  />
<br  />
above the shoulders of flowers<br  />
the questions planted answers<br  />
just what dissuaded the brightness<br  />
from filling my eyes with tears?<br  />
