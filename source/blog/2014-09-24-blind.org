#+BEGIN_VERSE
I encouraged slavery
against firefly's bravery
her light's a cheap delivery
Dark murders the scenery

I bribed the sun
to bring the dawn
she's crowned, no longer a pawn
yet torn apart, no longer one

I fooled the moon
not to wake up soon
behind my Eyes, her doom
a dream, at the brightest noon

above the shoulders of flowers
the questions planted answers
just what dissuaded the brightness
from filling my eyes with tears?
