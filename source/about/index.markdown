just enough to make sense  
not a tiny inch more  
maybe too much in a sense  
to plant what is growing inside  
the light in this primitive darkness!  
why are we afraid of the hate  
her love shall never radiate?  
  
said the tiny white scorpion  
walking through my left ear  
into my electrocuted skull  
i feel she's near  
yet i can not hear...
